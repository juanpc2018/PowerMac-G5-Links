seems Talos Raptor 2 is the dream come true, </br>
when Apple wanted to create a Next Gen G5 aka. "G6" before goint to intel, </br>
The G6 was panned to have a PPC405 controlling the board, an small PPC, and Big PPC CPUs. </br>
and thats exactly what Talos Raptor 2 is/has. </br>
Seems Talos Raptor 2 is the True Sussesoor of Apple G5 QUAD.  </br>
of course OSX is closed source, and OSX for PPC G5 is Big Endian,  </br>
New PowerCPUs are Bi-Endian, but most modern Linux OS for PPC </br>
are designed little.Endian, to make easy to port all software from x86_64 to PPC.  </br>
some Hardcore Linux developers like Void-Linux-PPC, Fienix, etc... </br>
are developing for Big.Endian, because its the correct way. </br>
Big.Endian (BE) = Left--to-->Right </br>
little.endian (el/le) = Left<--to--Right.</br>

other attemots to keep BE alive, were made along the way </br>
and to continue PPC legacy too, </br>
most notable efforts are the AmigaOS3/4, MorphOS, AROS, ApolloOS community.. </br>
HW using custom FPGA or Power5 CPUs, like: </br>
Amiga X5000, X1000, X500, etc... </br>

but has the same problem: </br>
High price + Niche Market = Difficult Adoption.  </br>

Talos machines were also inspiped by a paper writen in 1984 </br>
