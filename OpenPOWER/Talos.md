seems Talos Raptor 2 is the dream come true, </br>
when Apple-IBM-Motorola Eng. Team wanted to create a Next Gen G5 aka. "G6" before Apple going with intel, </br>
The G6 was planned to have a PPC405 controlling the board, an small PPC and Big PPC. </br>
big.Little kind of, </br>
and thats exactly what Talos Raptor 2 has. </br>
Talos Raptor 2 seems to be the True Sussesoor of Apple G5 QUAD, HW speaking,  </br>
of course OSX is closed source, and OSX for PPC G5 is Big.Endian,  </br>
someone found the abandoned source code and still develops OSX Sobert 10.5.9 for BE PPC, totally incompatible with modern OSX </br>
maybe someday, if that user has access to New PPC machines like Amiga X5000 or Talos Blackbird / Raptor2 </br>
maybe could adapt OSX Sobert to other PPC machines, </br>
maybe also AmigaOS4 could be adapted to run on other PPC machines. </br>
The main problem seems to be the different Boot systems, U-Boot, CHRP, etc... </br>
Fienix for example has 2 different iso versions, same OS, different Boot, </br>
similar happens with AmigaOS4 has different ISOs for different HW, </br>

New PowerCPUs are Bi-Endian, but most modern Linux OS for PPC </br>
are designed for little.Endian "ppc64le/ppc64el", </br>
the reason is to make easy/faster to port software from x86_64 to PPC atchitecture.  </br>
some Hardcore Linux developers like Void-Linux-PPC, Fienix, etc... </br>
are developing PPC for Big.Endian Only, because is the correct way. </br>
Big.Endian(BE) = Left--to-->Right </br>
little.endian(el/le) = Left<--to--Right </br>
True little.Endian = thgiR<--ot--tfeL </br>
thats why Debian, Fedora, Gentoo calls it "el" Not "le". </br> 

other attempts to keep (BE) alive, were made along the way </br>
efforts to continue PPC legacy too, </br>
most notable are the: AmigaOS3/4, MorphOS, AROS, ApolloOS community.. </br>
HW using custom FPGA or Power5 CPUs, like: </br>
Amiga X5000, X1000, X500, etc... </br>

but has the same problem: </br>
High price + Niche Market = Difficult Adoption.  </br>
No adoption = No developers. </br>

Talos machines were also inspiped by a paper:  </br>
